TODO

Default data needs to be mapped neatly to a database. To make it small
and consistent when making changes across areas.

e.g.

Table Sections
id name
1 Activities
2 Needs
3 Goals

Table Subsections
id name section_id
1 XYZ 3
2 ABC 3
3 QQQ 2

Multiple join subsections to sections

Further, subsections in Activities have another level below subsections,
since activities are grouped into categories.


Drink water, exercise, bedtime, hours of sleep?
