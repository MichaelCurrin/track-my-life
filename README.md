# Track My Life

_Author: Michael Currin_

Find ways to better measure, understand and improve your life with _Track My Life_, a web-based application for logging and analysing personal activity. 

The trackMyLife application is implemented in Python 2.7 and consists of a SQLite data managed with an ORM, a REST API and an HTML frontend for mobile and desktop consumption. The service is inspired by mobile apps on Android PlayStore, such as Daylio, Habitica and Water Drink reminder.

The kind of records I look to track for myself daily activities, mood, habits, goals, drinking water and driving/petrol. The idea is to track all of these in my own system, so that I can customise and centralise the creation of my personal data, then combine it however I wish when reporting and analysing it.

I am developing and hosting the app on https://pythonanywhere.com. I currently have the site password protected but will share at some stage.
