# trackMyLife
Web app for logging and analysing one's own personal activity 

This web app is intended for both mobile and desktop use. It is inspired by mobile apps on Android PlayStore, such as Daylio, Habitica and Water Drink reminder.

The kind of records I look to track for myself daily activities, mood, habits, goals, drinking water and driving/petrol. The idea is to track all of these in my own system, so that I can customise and centralise the creation of my personal data, then combine it however I wish when reporting and analysing it.

I am developing and hosting the app on https://pythonanywhere.com. I currently have the site password protected but will share at some stage.
