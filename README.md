# trackMyLife
Web app for logging and analysing one's own personal activity 

This web app is intended for both mobile and desktop use. It is inspired by mobile apps on Play Store, such as Daylio, Habitica and Water Drink reminder.

I am developing and hosting the app on https://pythonanywhere.com. I currently have the site password protected but will share at some stage.
